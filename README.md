## The Idea

This is my playground with PyTorch and time series predictors. The purpose of this
project is to experiment how ML models fit against statistical predictors and explore limits of the ML model


## Installation


### Step 1
This is platform-dependent, so first install relevant part here

https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

For Windows:

```
pip install torch==1.13.1+cu117 torchvision==0.14.1+cu117 torchaudio==0.13.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
pip install pytorch-forecasting
```
